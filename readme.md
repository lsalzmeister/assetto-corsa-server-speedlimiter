This Assetto Corsa Lua-Script is used to prevent cars from exceeding a certain speed limit.
If the speed limit is reached:
    - Clutch is engaged
    - Gas is disabled
    - Brake is engaged with force from .ini
    - A "slow-down"-message is displayed to the player
    - A message is sent to chat to let other players / admins know
